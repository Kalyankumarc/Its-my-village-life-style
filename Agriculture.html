				<h3>A Saga of Success</h3>
				<p>From a nation dependent on food imports to feed its population, India today is not only self-sufficient in grain production, but also has a substantial reserve and has of late started exporting appreciable quantitie of rice. The progress made by agriculture in the last four decades has been one of the biggest success stories of free India. Agriculture and allied activities constitute the single largest contributor to the Gross Domestic Product, almost 33% of it. Agriculture is the means of livelihood of about two-thirds of the work force in the country.</p>
				<p><strong>Agriculture History:</strong>Agriculture is the science and practice of cultivating of land, producing crops, and raising animals. It also refers to many associated processes or enterprises,such as food processing.No one knows precisely when humans first started a sustained, systematic practice of agriculture, but evidence has shown signs of agriculture in the Andhra Pradesh.Some of the earliest cultivated crops included Paddy, Cotton, Tobacco and Mirchi. The presence of larger scale, systematic cultivation often preceded or accompanied <strong>the rise of villages and cities and the formation of organized civilization.</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Government Policies:</strong>It is in the best interests of all governments to formulate policies that are beneficial to farmers. A stable, reasonably-priced food supply and productive, well-paid farmers are two very important components of a stable society. However, the combination of cheap food for consumers and high market prices for farmers is very difficult to achieve. Some common policy tools include:</p>

				<ol>
					<li><p><strong>subsidies:</strong>A subsidy is money a government pays to farmers to guaranty that they receive a certain price for their crops.</p></li>

					<li><p><strong>production limits:</strong>Some governments pay farmers NOT to grow certain crops, or even to leave some land unused (fallow). The goal of this policy is to reduce supply and keep prices relatively high.</li></p>

					<li><p><strong>agricultural research:</strong>Governments often finance agricultural research to investigate promoting better-yielding crop varieties, eliminate diseases, fight pests, improve processing methods, etc.</p></li>
